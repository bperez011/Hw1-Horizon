# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenges in This Course

There are two types of Challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

### Challenge Types 

The two types of Challenges are the following:

* **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** give you starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

* **Job-seeking coding assessments** or **take-home assignments** don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.

### Challenge Elements

Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

> **Deep Dive**: To learn more about agile, read this [Wikipedia article on agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

Each Challenge contains the following elements:

* **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them." 

* **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called **scenario-oriented criteria** which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of Challenges. 

* **Mock-up**: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.
